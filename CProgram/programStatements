7/Accept number from user and return summation
//input=4 o/p=4+3+2+1=10

8/Accept number from user and check whether number is even or odd


9/Accept choice from user for gold coin  and return bill using switch case
//1 gram=4000     2 gram=8000    5 gram=20000      10 gram=40000


10/Accept choice from user for gold coin  and return bill using if else 
//1 gram=4000     2 gram=8000    5 gram=20000      10 gram=40000


11/Accept percentage f from user and check whether student is in which class like pass,fail,distingtion 
//0 to 35 --------------> Fail
//35 to 50 ------------->Pass
//50 to 60 ------------->Second class
//60 to 70  ------------>first class
//70 to 100 ------------>first class with Distingtion


12/Accept number from user and check whether number is divisible by 5 and 3 
//using int rather than bool
//use bool insted of int because int required 32 bit more memory than bool

13/Accept number from user and check whether number is divisible by 5 and 3   using int

###########Problems on number:#################

1)In this topic we accept number in decimal format from user and we have to perform operation on that number.
2)Almost every questions based on numbers required loop for iteration.

we haveto optimise the number of iterations to reduce the time complexity if it is possible.

#############Time complexity###############

Time complexity of every application is directly depends on a loop that we used to solve the problem statement.
As good programming practice our target is used to reduce the number of iterations without affecting logic. application with the list time complexity is consider as and efficient application.
time complexity is only there in the application if it uses iteration (loop).



21/Accept number from user and find the factors of that number  
/Time complexity is O(N/2)

/every time not possible to reduce Time complexity 
/in program29.c  we need to iterate for loop n times to get non factor
/in program30.c we iterate loop n/2

22/Accept number from user and return summation of that factors

23/Accept number from user and return that number is perfect or not :
/Perfect means summation of factor is equal to that number eg.6     factor is 1,2,3 then 1+2+3=6

********************/problems on Digits********************

/Accept number from user and display separet digit of that number
/Input :34567
/output :7  6   5   4   3


/Accept number fro user  and return  sum of digits 
/INPUT: 1234
/OUTPUt:1+2+3+4=10

/ Accept number from user and return reverse number;
/ Accept number from user and return reverse number  and check palindrom or not
